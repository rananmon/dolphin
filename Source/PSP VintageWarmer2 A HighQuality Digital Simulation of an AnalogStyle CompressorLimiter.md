PSP VintageWarmer2 is highly flexible and can be used for both soft-knee compression and brick-wall limiting. This makes it an essential tool for mixing and mastering engineers. Careful attention has been paid to PSP Vintage Warmer's overload characteristics with the algorithm being capable of generating saturation effects typical of analog tape recorders. PSP Vintage Warmer also incorporates professional VU and PPM metering together with accurate overload indicators thereby ensuring professional quality results.
 
PSP VintageWarmer2 version installer contains 3 versions of the plugin: PSP MicroWarmer, PSP VintageWarmer (LE), and PSP VintageWarmer2. PSP MicroWarmer provides the same sound quality as its siblings, but with a simplified single-band interface and low latency performance optimized for use on individual tracks. PSP VintageWarmer (LE) is a direct descendant of the original PSP VintageWarmer, with its all strengths such as low resource usage and latency. PSP VintageWarmer2 includes the acclaimed FAT double sampling mode for even more accurate analog sounding processing.
 
We strongly recommend that you use PSP VintageWarmer (LE) or PSP MicroWarmer in multi-tracking applications, except in situations where FAT mode is important. PSP VintageWarmer2 is recommended for use in mastering sessions or when processing groups or master busses.
