In this article, we will show you how to use V 2 16 Audaces Digiflash, which is compatible with Audaces 7 and 5.5 versions. You will learn how to:
 
- Set up your camera or smartphone and prepare your paper patterns for digitization
- Choose between automatic or manual digitization modes
- Edit and adjust the digitized patterns
- Add marks, notches, grainlines and text information to the patterns
- Export the patterns to Audaces Moldes or other formats

## Setting up your camera or smartphone and preparing your paper patterns
 
To use Audaces Digiflash, you will need a camera or a smartphone that can take high-resolution pictures. You will also need a tripod or a stand to hold your device steady and at a right angle to the paper patterns. The ideal distance between the device and the patterns is about 1.5 meters.
 
You will also need to prepare your paper patterns for digitization. Make sure they are flat and smooth, without any wrinkles or folds. If possible, use white paper with black lines for better contrast. You can also use colored paper or markers, but avoid using colors that are similar to the background or the table. You should also avoid using reflective materials or tapes that can cause glare.
 
Before taking pictures of your paper patterns, you should calibrate your device using a calibration sheet provided by Audaces. The calibration sheet is a printed page with a grid of black dots and a QR code. You should place it on the same table where you will digitize your patterns, and take a picture of it using your device. The software will use this picture to adjust the perspective and scale of your digitized patterns.
 
## Choosing between automatic or manual digitization modes
 
Audaces Digiflash offers two modes of digitization: automatic and manual. In the automatic mode, the software will detect the contours of your paper patterns automatically and create digital patterns based on them. In the manual mode, you will have to trace the contours of your paper patterns manually using your mouse or a pen tablet.
 
To use the automatic mode, you should place your paper patterns on the table in a way that they do not overlap or touch each other. You should also leave some space between them and the edges of the table. Then, you should take a picture of them using your device and import it into the software. The software will analyze the picture and show you the digitized patterns on the screen. You can then edit and adjust them as needed.
 
To use the manual mode, you can place your paper patterns on the table in any way you want, as long as they are visible and clear. You can also take multiple pictures of them if they are too large or complex. Then, you should import each picture into the software and trace the contours of each pattern piece manually using your mouse or a pen tablet. You can also edit and adjust them as needed.
 
## Editing and adjusting the digitized patterns
 
After digitizing your paper patterns, you can edit and adjust them using various tools in Audaces Digiflash. For example, you can:

- Move, rotate, scale or flip the pattern pieces
- Add or delete points on the contours
- Smooth or straighten the curves
- Join or split pattern pieces
- Cut or copy pattern pieces
- Undo or redo changes

You can also preview how your digitized patterns will look like in Audaces Moldes or other formats by clicking on the "View" button.
